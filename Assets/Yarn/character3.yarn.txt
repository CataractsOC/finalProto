    phreekster: Uh oh, new guy on board.
    phreekster: Hey, everyone!
    phreekster: WE GOT A NEW GUY HERE!
    phreekster: NEW KIDS ON THE BLOCK!
    phreekster: DONNIE WAHLBERG IN THE BUILDING!
    phreekster: Haha, just kidding.
    phreekster: But seriously, if you're new, talk to Decker.

    phreekster: Oops, you've got the wrong directions. You'll need to see sn0w first.
    phreekster: Oh and uh,
    phreekster: could you remind her to confirm that e-vite for that fancy dinner date?
    phreekster: It's been about one week now...

    phreekster: Go home and rest, friend. I'll send you an email to your DEC in the morning.
    phreekster: Don't worry, it won't be a virus.
    phreekster: Most likely.

phreekster: Oh hi, I didn't see you there.
phreekster: I'm phreekster, superhuman and cyberspeeder extrordinaire.
phreekster: I'll tell you everything you need to know about HEXware and botnetting.
phreekster: I'll save the juicy bits for the live demonstration, but here's what you need to know:
phreekster: Certain HEX require certain types of hardware to cast or transmit,
phreekster: and more powerful HEX requires beefier configurations.
phreekster: Every piece of gear you grab is useless until you hook it up to your rig, or your DEC.
phreekster: HEXware components have different types, specs, and compatibility with other HEXware.
phreekster: On the software side of things you have, of course, your HEX.
phreekster: Now, if you're serious about being a Hexxor, you should know a few things about transmitting HEX.
phreekster: You won't make it far if you open up an email tomorrow and get zapped with someone else's HEX.
phreekster: That's where your zombies come in.
phreekster: You can proxy HEX in or out through your botnet so your zombies get siphoned instead just in case someone tries to hit you.
phreekster: The bigger your botnet, the better gear you'll need to sustain your connection to its power,
phreekster: and the more protection you'll have for when someone tries to drain you.
phreekster: That's all I'll say for now.
phreekster: I'll send you an email tomorrow for a live demo of what you can do,
phreekster: and I'll give you access to a small HEXnet sandbox to play around in.
phreekster: Welcome to the club, buddy!
