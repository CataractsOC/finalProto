	Decker: I don't like repeating myself, kid. This is charity work for me as is.

Decker: Hey there, stranger. Congrats on making it this far.
Decker: Assuming you didn't find this place by mistake,
Decker: and, if you're already here,
Decker: there's no way you don't know what you're getting into.
Decker: So, you're looking to be a Hexxor?

-> Yeah, sounds about right.
	Decker: Great, let's get started then.
-> No, not at all.
	Decker: Hah! A good sense of humor'll help you out a lot in this line of work.

Decker: You probably already know this, but I'm old fashioned so I'll give you the usual history lecture before we get down to business.
Decker: Around 1982, there was a huge moral panic happening in the US revolving around Satanism, more specifically, the increased youth interest in performing dark rites.
Decker: By then, Big Bub was already losing a lot of her following to new age movements and eastern religion.
Decker: So she figured that the best way to fight the current and to stay current was to go digital.
Decker: She said that "computers were going to change everything," and she was right.
Decker: It's '96 now, and computers are the hottest thing since hell.
Decker: Before the internet, Hexxors had to farm zombies and bring in new blood by word of mouth,
Decker: but now that we have things like e-mail and BBS, our jobs have gotten a lot easier.
Decker: And that's where we are, any questions?

Decker: Like I said before, you should already know what you're getting into.
Decker: But fine, I'll explain it.
Decker: Hexxors are the Devil's digital recruiters.
Decker: In the old days, you had to actually persuade people to buy into the whole Satanic thing.
Decker: Now, all you have to do is send a virus as an attachment and they're automatically hypno'd into becoming a zombie the next time they open their email.
Decker: In exchange for gathering zombies, Beezy grants you a percentage of the power she siphons from their souls.
Decker: As you network more zombies, you'll get more power, and you'll be able to use more powerful HEX.
Decker: Depending on the HEX and what they do, you can use them to gather zombies faster.
Decker: Either that,
Decker: or you can use HEX try to kill other Hexxors to absorb their botnets.
Decker: Just be aware that doing the latter puts a target on your back, and being a Hexxor means you're eventually gonna have to kill or be killed.
Decker: Some of us are powerful enough that we don't need to fight, and Hexxors think twice before trying to fight one of us.
Decker: That's about the long and short of it.
Decker: Go over and talk to sn0w to get started with using HEX.
