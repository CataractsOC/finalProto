sn0w: Hi, I'm sn0w. I'm guessing you came over to learn about HEX?

-> Not really.
    sn0w: Okay, whatever.
    [[character1.null]]
-> Yeah, Decker told me to speak with you.
    sn0w:Of course he did.

sn0w: You're looking at the gal who practically invented HEX.
sn0w: Well, maybe not the one to invent it.
sn0w: But I did absorb my college roommate who did, and she was the first ever Hexxor!
sn0w: Anyways, let's get you going with some starter HEX.
sn0w: I cloned your handle when you walked in here, and I've already sent a test spell to your DEC.
sn0w: It's a basic soul siphon that only works on non-Hexxors, so don't get any ideas.
sn0w: Generally speaking, HEX is a type of black magik that not only works in the physical world,
sn0w: but whose effects can also be transmitted over the wire.
sn0w: Different kinds of HEX have different effects, and with varying degrees.
sn0w: And you can even modify or code your own HEX if you have the spare time.
sn0w: Every time you use HEX, the cost of the cast is from your own power in the form of soul energy.
sn0w: If you let your soul energy completely deplete, you die.
sn0w: If another Hexxor siphons all of your soul energy, you die.
sn0w: If you write a pooly-coded HEX and it accidentally corrupts your soul, you die.
sn0w: The lesson here is, if you're not ready to accept the risk of death, don't mess with HEX.
sn0w: That's all I've got to teach you for now.
sn0w: If you wanna come back and buy HEX,
sn0w: or if you want to learn more when you have more power, come see me.
sn0w: Go talk to the guy at the end of the mausoleum.
