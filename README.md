# finalProto - Hexx0r: The Cybersatanic Hacker RPG

## Unity Project Description

### Prerequisites

This prototype requires Unity 2018.1.8f1 or later to open. 

It also requires that you import the probuilder and yarnspinner unity packages. 

The ProBuilder package can be imported from the pagkage manager window, and YarnSpinner can be downloaded and imported from: 

https://github.com/thesecretlab/YarnSpinner/releases

### Technical Description

This is a prototype for the final project submission.

This prototype is meant to demonstrate environment grayboxing using ProBuilder as well as dialogue management using YarnSpinner. A description and the source for YarnSpinner can be found at:

InfiniteAmmo's YarnSpinner is meant to be implemented mainly in 2D games, but I wanted to see if it would play nicely with a 3D prototype instead. I've modified the scripts included in the package in order to do so.

To speak with NPCs, get close to them and hit space. All controls for player movement and mouselook should freeze up when you're in a conversation.

## Project Background

I'm a really big fan of exploitation films of the 70s and 80s related to the Satanic panic that was going on at the time. I'm also pretty enamored by 80s and 90s hacker culture. I drew a lot of themes from films such as 1982's Evilspeak as well as 1995's Hackers and 1992's Sneakers and tried to mash them together in something I thought might be interesting.


The project features conditional dialogue trees, so players are given dialogue choices that lead to different bits of conversation. Try playing the scene multiple times and talking to NPCs that you shouldn't be. If you're curious as to what dialogue you may have missed, you can open up the \*.yarn.txt files located in Assets\Yarn.



Enjoy!
